### What I learned

I learned that images can be displayed hidden at different screen sizes, the use of hr tags, and how to properly use landmarks.

```html
<hr>
```
```css
.accordion-item:target .answer {
    max-height: 10rem;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to start implementing bootstrap into my projects. This way, I may be able to cut down the time it takes for me to finish a site.
